# SVO

These samples show how to use ZED SDK for recording and playback SVO files. SVO files are a proprietary format developed by Stereolabs, designed to facilitate the storage and replay of data captured by the ZED camera. You can find additional information on the **video recording features** in our [Documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/video/recording/).
