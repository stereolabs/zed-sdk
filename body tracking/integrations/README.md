# Using Body Tracking with external software

The **Body Tracking module** of the ZED SDK provides real-time human body tracking capabilities, allowing developers to create immersive applications that can track and interact with human body movements in 3D space. The ZED SDK provides integrations for popular game engines such as **Unity** and **Unreal Engine 5**, as well as additional integrations with **Unity using LiveLink** and **Unreal Engine with LiveLink**.

Each integration is available in its own repository, containing samples and tutorials to get started integrating the ZED SDK into your new or existing project.
