# Spatial Mapping

These samples provide a comprehensive overview of how to leverage the ZED SDK for effective spatial mapping using a single ZED camera. With these samples, users can gain a solid understanding of how to utilize the ZED stereo camera to create detailed 3D maps of indoor and outdoor environments, all without requiring the use of additional sensors or equipment. You can find additional information on the  Spatial Mapping module in our [Documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/spatial-mapping/) and [API Reference](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/api/group__SpatialMapping__group.html).
