# Plane Detection Samples

These samples show how to use ZED SDK for **plane detection**. You can find additional information on the Plane Detection features in our [Documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/spatial-mapping/plane-detection/).

## Overview

This section contains the following code samples:

 - [Floor Plane Sample](./floor%20plane/): This sample shows two ways to automatically detect the floor plane and set it as origin of a virtual view.

 - [Plane Detection Sample](./plane%20detection/): This sample shows how to perform plane detection with a ZED Camera. You can use either the plane at hit functionality or the automatic floor plane detection.
