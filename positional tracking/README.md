# Stereolabs ZED - Positional Tracking

This sample shows how to track camera motion in space and display it in an OpenGL window. It demonstrates how to:

- Get position and orientation of the device using the API
- Select your coordinate system, frames and units
- Tranform pose data at the center of the camera
- Write pose data and timestamps in a CSV file
- Display camera motion in an OpenGL window

## Getting started

- First, download the latest version of the ZED SDK on [stereolabs.com](https://www.stereolabs.com).
- For more information, read the ZED [API documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/documentation/API/).

*NOTE*: To improve tracking performance, we recommend using the ZED in HD720 mode at 60fps.
