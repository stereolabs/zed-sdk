# Stereolabs ZED - Depth Sensing

This sample captures a 3D point cloud and display it in an OpenGL window. It shows how to:
- Adjust depth and texture confidence filters
- Get a 3D point cloud with the API.
- Display point cloud in OpenGL.
- Use a thread to capture the point cloud and update the GL window simultaneously.

To retrieve a depth map of the scene, see [Depth Sensing](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-examples/tree/master/tutorials) tutorial.

## Getting started

- First, download the latest version of the ZED SDK on [stereolabs.com](https://www.stereolabs.com).
- For more information, read the ZED [API documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/documentation/API/).
